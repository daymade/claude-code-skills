## Skill Authoring Guidelines

### Writing Style

Use **imperative/infinitive form** throughout:

‚úÖ **Good:**
```markdown
Extract files from a repomix file using the bundled script.
```

‚ùå **Bad:**
```markdown
You should extract files from a repomix file by using the script.
```

### Documentation Structure

Follow this pattern:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Clear description with activation triggers. Activates when...
---

# Skill Name

## Overview
[1-2 sentence explanation]

## When to Use This Skill
[Bullet list of activation scenarios]

## Core Workflow
[Step-by-step instructions]

## Resources
[Reference bundled files]
```

### Bundled Resources

- **scripts/**: Executable code (Python/Bash) for automation
- **references/**: Documentation loaded as needed
- **assets/**: Templates/files used in output

Keep SKILL.md lean (~100-500 lines). Move detailed content to `references/`.

## Code Quality

### Python Scripts

- Use Python 3.6+ compatible syntax
- Include proper shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Add docstrings for functions
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- No external dependencies (or document them clearly)

### Bash Scripts

- Include shebang: `#!/bin/bash`
- Use `set -e` for error handling
- Add comments for complex operations
- Make scripts executable: `chmod +x script.sh`
