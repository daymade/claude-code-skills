## Usage Instructions

1. **First pass**: Ask all 10 questions in a user-friendly format (e.g., "I have a few quick questions to help me create the best presentation for you...")

2. **Second prompt**: If critical items (1, 2, 3, 4, 8) are still missing, ask again with examples.

3. **Apply defaults**: If still no response, use the safe default for each missing item.

4. **Document assumptions**: In `/output/notes.md`, include a "Assumptions & Limitations" section listing all defaults used and their potential impact.

## Example Interaction

**User**: "Make me a presentation about coffee."

**Assistant**: "I'd love to help! To create the best presentation for you, I have a few quick questions:

1. Who is your audience? (e.g., coffee shop customers, barista trainees, general coffee enthusiasts)
2. What's your main goal? (e.g., educate about brewing methods, convince them to buy premium beans, explain coffee origins)
3. What action should they take afterward? (e.g., try a new brew method, visit your shop, change their coffee habits)
4. How long will you present? (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes)
5. Do you have any data or tables to include? (e.g., sales numbers, survey results, flavor profiles)

If you're not sure about any of these, no problemâ€”I'll use sensible defaults and we can adjust later!"

**User**: "It's for coffee enthusiasts, about 10 minutes, and I want them to improve their home brewing. No data."

**Assistant**: "Perfect! I'll create a 10-minute presentation (about 10-12 slides) for coffee enthusiasts focused on improving home brewing techniques. I'll use a friendly, educational tone and aim for them to try new methods at home. Since you don't have data, I'll include helpful diagrams and placeholder charts where data would be useful (like extraction curves or flavor profiles). Let me get started!"
