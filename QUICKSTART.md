# Quick Start Guide

Get started with Claude Code Skills Marketplace in less than 2 minutes!

## For Skill Creators

**Want to create your own skills? Start here!**

### Step 1: Install skill-creator

```bash
# Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add daymade/claude-code-skills

# Install skill-creator
claude plugin install skill-creator@daymade/claude-code-skills
```

### Step 2: Initialize Your First Skill

```bash
# Create a new skill from template
skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py my-first-skill --path ~/my-skills
```

This generates:
```
~/my-skills/my-first-skill/
├── SKILL.md                  # Main skill file
├── scripts/                  # Executable code
│   └── example_script.py
├── references/               # Documentation
│   └── example_reference.md
└── assets/                   # Templates/resources
    └── example_asset.txt
```

### Step 3: Customize Your Skill

Edit `~/my-skills/my-first-skill/SKILL.md`:

1. **Update frontmatter** - Set name and description
2. **Write "When to Use This Skill"** - Define activation criteria
3. **Document workflows** - Explain how Claude should use your skill
4. **Add resources** - Create scripts, references, or assets as needed

### Step 4: Validate Your Skill

```bash
# Check if your skill meets quality standards
skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py ~/my-skills/my-first-skill
```

Fix any errors reported, then validate again.

### Step 5: Package for Distribution

```bash
# Create a distributable .zip file
skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py ~/my-skills/my-first-skill
```

This creates `my-first-skill.zip` ready to share!

### Step 6: Test Your Skill

```bash
# Copy to Claude Code skills directory
cp -r ~/my-skills/my-first-skill ~/.claude/skills/

# Restart Claude Code
# Your skill is now active!
```

3. Test response times to find the fastest endpoint
4. Then install Claude Code skills normally

**Why CC-Switch?**
