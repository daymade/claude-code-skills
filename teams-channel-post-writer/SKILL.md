# Teams Channel Post Writer

## Overview

Create well-structured, educational Teams channel posts for internal knowledge sharing about Claude Code features and best practices. This skill provides templates, writing guidelines, and a structured workflow to produce consistent, actionable content that helps colleagues learn effective Claude Code usage.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when creating Teams channel posts to:
- Announce and explain new Claude Code features
- Share Claude Code tips and best practices
- Teach effective prompting patterns and workflows
- Connect features to broader engineering principles (e.g., context engineering)
- Document lessons learned from using Claude Code

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Topic

Gather information about what to write about:
- Research the feature/topic thoroughly using official documentation
- Verify release dates and version numbers from changelogs
- Identify the core benefit or principle the post should teach
- Collect concrete examples from real usage

**Research checklist:**
- [ ] Found official release date/version number
- [ ] Verified feature behavior through testing or documentation
- [ ] Identified authoritative sources to link to
- [ ] Understood the underlying principle or best practice

### 2. Plan the Content

Based on the writing guidelines in `references/writing-guidelines.md`, plan:
- **Hook**: What's new or important about this topic?
- **Core principle**: What best practice does this illustrate?
- **Examples**: What concrete prompts or workflows demonstrate this?
- **Call-to-action**: What should readers try next?

### 3. Draft Using the Template

Start with the template in `assets/post-template.md` and fill in:

1. **Title**: Use an emoji and clear description
2. **Introduction**: Include release date and brief context
3. **What it is**: 1-2 sentence explanation
4. **How to use it**: Show "Normal vs Better" pattern with explicit instructions
5. **Why use it**: Explain the underlying principle with 4 key benefits
6. **Examples**: Provide 3+ realistic, concrete prompts
7. **Options/Settings**: List key configurations or parameters
8. **Call-to-action**: End with actionable next step
9. **Learn more**: Link to authoritative resources

### 4. Apply Writing Guidelines

Review the draft against the quality checklist in `references/writing-guidelines.md`:
- Educational and helpful tone
- "Normal/Better" pattern (not "Wrong/Correct")
- Concrete, realistic examples
- Explains the "why" with principles
- Clear structure with bullets and formatting
- Verified facts and dates

### 5. Save and Share

Save the final post to your team's documentation location with a descriptive filename like "Claude Code Tips.md" or "[Topic Name].md"

## Key Principles

### Show, Don't Just Tell
Always include concrete examples users can adapt. Use "Normal vs Better" comparisons to demonstrate improvements without making readers feel criticized.

### Connect to Principles
Don't just describe featuresâ€”explain the underlying best practices. For example, connect the Explore agent to "context offloading" principles in context engineering.

### Make it Actionable
Be explicit about invocation patterns. Users should be able to copy/paste examples and immediately use them.

### Verify Everything
Always research release dates, verify feature behavior, and link to authoritative sources. Accuracy builds trust.
